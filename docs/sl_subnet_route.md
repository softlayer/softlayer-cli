## sl subnet route

Change how a secondary subnet is routed.

### Synopsis

Allows you to change the route of your secondary subnets.
Subnets may be routed as either Static or Portable, and that designation is dictated by the routing destination specified.
Static subnets have an ultimate routing destination of a single IP address but may not be routed to an existing subnetâ€™s IP address whose subnet is routed as a Static.
Portable subnets have an ultimate routing destination of a VLAN.
A subnet can be routed to any resource within the same 'routing region' as the subnet itself, usually limited to a single data center.

	${COMMAND_NAME} sl subnet route 1234567 --ip 11.22.33.44
	${COMMAND_NAME} sl subnet route 1234567 --server myUniqueHostname<domain.com>
	${COMMAND_NAME} sl subnet route 1234567 --vsi vsiId
	${COMMAND_NAME} sl subnet route 1234567 --vlan vlanId



```

### Options

```
  -i, --ip string       A Network_Subnet_IpAddress.id, A dotted-quad IPv4 address, or A full or compressed IPv6 address.
  -s, --server string   A Hardware_Server.id or UUID value of the desired server. A value corresponding to a unique
                        fully-qualified domain name in the format 'hostname<domain>' where < and > are literal, e.g. myhost<mydomain.com>
  -l, --vlan string     A Network_Vlan.id value of the desired VLAN or A semantic VLAN identifier of the form <data center short name>.<router>.<vlan number>,
                        eg. dal13.fcr01.1234 - the router name may optionally contain the 'a' or 'b' redundancy qualifier 
  -v, --vsi string      A Virtual_Guest.id or UUID value of the desired server. A value corresponding to a unique
                        fully-qualified domain name in the format 'hostname<domain>' where < and > are literal, e.g. myhost<mydomain.com>
