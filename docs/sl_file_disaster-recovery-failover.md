## sl file disaster-recovery-failover

Failover an inaccessible volume to its available replicant volume.

### Synopsis

If a volume (with replication) becomes inaccessible due to a disaster event, this method can be used to immediately
failover to an available replica in another location. This method does not allow for fail back via the API.
To fail back to the original volume after using this method, open a support ticket.
To test failover, use '${COMMAND_NAME} sl file replica-failover' instead.

EXAMPLE:
	${COMMAND_NAME} sl file disaster-recovery-failover 12345678 87654321
	This command performs failover operation for volume with ID 12345678 to replica volume with ID 87654321.
