## sl ipsec subnet-add

Add a subnet to an IPSec tunnel context

### Synopsis

${COMMAND_NAME} sl ipsec subnet-add CONTEXT_ID [OPTIONS] 

  Add a subnet to an IPSEC tunnel context.

  A subnet id may be specified to link to the existing tunnel context.

  Otherwise, a network identifier in CIDR notation should be specified,
  indicating that a subnet resource should first be created before
  associating it with the tunnel context. Note that this is only supported
  for remote subnets, which are also deleted upon failure to attach to a
  context.

  A separate configuration request should be made to realize changes on
  network devices.
